# StartupSuccessPrediction

"StartupSuccessPrediction" is an innovative project harnessing Jupyter Notebook and Linear Regression to predict startup success. It utilizes a dataset collected from Kaggle and employs a unique validation criterion. Startups with total funding greater than or equal to $500,000, at least one funding round, and a status of "operating," "acquired," or "ipo" are classified as successful; otherwise, they are marked as failures.

The project's predictive outcomes are stored in a separate file, clearly indicating whether a startup is deemed a success or failure.
